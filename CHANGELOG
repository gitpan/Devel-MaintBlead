        Always exit with failure if there is an internal error (instead of
        useing -die-, which would get hidden by the eval).

0.03    4 June 2012
        Added support for "default" setting, so additional runs of Makefile.PL
        without code version, will keep using the one that was last seen.
        Made sure that we will never overwrite any files when switching
        between states.  Also added test-suite.

        Fixed problem with "die" not exiting the script if called inside an
        eval.  Also made sure the line number mentioned is correct, when it
        is impossible to run "blead" on the version of perl given.

        First version of Devel::MaintBlead.  No real tests yet.
